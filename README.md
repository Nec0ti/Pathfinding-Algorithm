# Pathfinding Visualizer

A web-based interactive tool for visualizing various pathfinding algorithms in action. This project provides a hands-on way to understand how algorithms like A*, Dijkstra's, and Breadth-First Search find the shortest path between two points.

## Features

*   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from A*, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Breadth-First Search to compare their performance.
*   **Interactive Grid:** Create walls by clicking and dragging on the grid to simulate obstacles.
*   **Start/End Nodes:** Visualize the path from a defined start node to an end node.
*   **Clear Visualization:** Easily see how each algorithm explores the grid to find the optimal path.
*   **Customizable Grid Size:** Adjust the grid size to create more complex scenarios.
*   **Dark/Light Theme:** Toggle between a dark and light theme for comfortable viewing.
*   **Wall Creation/Erasal**: Left-click to create walls, right-click to erase them.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript

## How to Use

1.  **Open the website:** https://nec0ti.github.io/Pathfinding-Algorithm/ 
3.  **Create Walls:** Click and drag on the grid to create walls that represent obstacles.
4.  **Select an Algorithm:** Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
5.  **Run the Algorithm:** Click the "Run" button to visualize the pathfinding process.
6.  **Reset the Grid:** Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start over.
7.  **Change Grid Size:** Input the new desired grid size into the text field and it will automatically change the grid size.
8.  **Toggle Themes:** Click the "Toggle Theme" button to change between dark and light themes.

## Implemented Algorithms

*   A* Search: A popular pathfinding algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to the end node.
*   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in the grid.
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores the grid level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

## Future Enhancements

*   **More Algorithms:** Implement additional pathfinding algorithms like Greedy Best-First Search and Jump Point Search.
*   **Animation Control:** Add controls for adjusting the animation speed of the pathfinding process.
*   **Heuristic Selection:** Allow users to choose different heuristic functions for A*.
*   **Weight Visualization:** Add support for weighted graphs and visualize the cost of traversing each node.
*   **Mobile Optimization:** Improve the app's responsiveness and usability on mobile devices.
